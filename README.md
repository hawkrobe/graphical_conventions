## Experiments

We ran four different experiments:

* initial repeated communication task (`/experiments/reference-game/`)
* sketch recognition task (`/experiments/recognition/`)
* sketch-mapping task linking strokes to regions of target object (`/experiments/sketch-mapping/`)
* diagnosticity mapping task (`/experiments/object-diagnosticity/`)

## Data

Pull down pre-processed data by running `/data/download_data.py`

## Analyses

* Reproduce behavioral analyses by running `/analysis/refgame.Rmd` notebook.
* Reproduce diagnosticity analyses by running `/analysis/diagnosticity.Rmd` notebook.
