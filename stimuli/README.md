# Instructions 

First download raw data with `python download_data.py`.

To extract CNN features from sketches, use as follows: 

`python extract_features.py --data='../data/diagnosticity/sketches/refgame1.2/png/' --layer_ind=6 --data_type='images' --spatial_avg=True`

## Datasets

`graphical_conventions_sketches_yoked` : 67 bundles of 40 trials (each bundle corresponding to 1 refgame)

`graphical_conventions_sketches_scrambled40` : 67 bundles of 40 trials (the four trials of each repetition coming from different games)

`graphical_conventions_sketches_scrambled10` : 268 bundles of 10 trials (each trial corresponding to some repetition (8 repeated + 2 control))

Note that `recog_id` refers to a unique session type in the recognition experiment, where all the sketches are guaranteed to have been generated by different participants in different repetition cycles.
